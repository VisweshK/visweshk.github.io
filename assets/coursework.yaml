    - name: CS199 AI for Healthcare Bootcamp
      desc: "By far the most fun class of the quarter. This class fit really well with my current
      interests. Weekly paper reading and skill building sections were extremely educational. 
      Interestingly, most selected for the bootcamp tend to be seniors/masters students studying AI.
       10/10"
    - name: CS103 Mathematical Foundations of Computing
      desc: "The interesting material in this class is once again spaced over the last few weeks
      with Automata, CFGs and Turing Machines. If you have a background in proof based 
      math, take CS154 instead. The TAs are super helpful in office hours but they tend to be 
      extremely nitpicky while grading psets. Dr. Lee's lectures and slides tended to get drawn 
      out at times. 4/10"
    - name: CS109 Introduction to Probability for Computer Scientists
      desc: "The material in this class was super interesting over the last few weeks as we 
      entered machine learning. Most of the grade from the class came from the psets, which 
      are not graded 'strictly' by the TAs. 6/10"
    - name: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Modern Applications
      desc: "I found this class quite slow, only reaching more advanced topics only at the end 
      of the quarter. The textbook for the class is comprehensive and contains a healthy dose of 
      application of the concepts covered. Overall, I wished I had taken the Advanced math series.

  courses:
    - name: CS106X Programming Abstractions (Accelerated)
      desc: "I was debating about CS106B/X/107 for a while before taking the class and I'm sure
      I made the right choice because I absolutely loved the class! Jerry is a fantastic 
      lecturer, the assignments were fun and the final project ensured that I was able to 
      finish a graph algorithm project I'd put on hold after summer. Bonus: there were a bunch 
      of optional coding problems where you can get a free dinner with Jerry! 10/10"
    - name: ESF10 Education as Self-Fashioning - Unintended Consequences
      desc: "ESF is definitely the best way to complete your freshman writing requirements.
      I choose a STEM oriented ESF because I haven't had much literature/
      writing exposure in high school and it worked out. Prof. Gerritsen is really fun and 
      knowledgeable and brought in guest speakers on various subjects around our class theme. 
      The class was not as intensive as I expected, only ramping in the last few weeks with the 
      final paper. 8/10"
    - name: CS106L Standard C++ Programming Laboratory
      desc: "Pretty informative. It brings out a lot of the new features of C++ 
      that CS106B/X would skip. Good supplement to CS106B/X, but also worth taking if you need 
      to write C++ code in industry. 7/10"
    - name: CS522 Seminar in Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare
      desc: "The class brought in big names (Vinod Khosla) doing interesting work which made 
      some seminars worthwhile. Overall, the seminars lacked technical depth, making them most 
      effective for those who want to know if healthcare is interesting. 7/10"
    - name: Stats48N Riding the Data Wave
      desc: "This was a writing-heavy intro to stats class. The lectures were interesting, building 
      up from distributions through to PCA. The weekly two-page homework required a written statistical 
      analysis and turned out to be the biggest negative of the class. 3/10"
