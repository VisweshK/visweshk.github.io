Welcome to my homepage! I'm Viswesh, a Stanford '23 undergrad from Bangalore, India. I'm interested
in computer science, math and healthcare and I'm passionate about building cool things that can make an impact at scale.

At Stanford, I'm majoring in Computer Science, focusing on Artificial Intelligence, and Systems (checkout the coursework tab).
I'm a part of the [AI for Healthcare Bootcamp](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/programs/aihc-bootcamp/) in the 
[Stanford ML Group](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/) where I've been working with on using AI
to digitize pathology data ([GloFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15269)).

Over the past year I've been developing [Kanna](https://kanna.ai) - a patented, clinically validated system that can
detect eye diseases in children using just a mobilephone - with my brother [Vrishab Krishna](https://vrishabkrishna.com).
We're looking to partner with healthcare providers to take this technology to the masses!

My CV and other projects are scattered over [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/visweshk/), 
[Github](https://www.github.com/visweshk) and [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y4wJRpQAAAAJ&hl=en).
