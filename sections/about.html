Welcome to my homepage! I'm Viswesh, a Stanford '23 undergrad from Bangalore, India. I'm interested
in computer science, math and biology and I'm passionate about building cool things that can make an impact at scale.

At Stanford, I'm majoring in Computer Science, potentially specializing in Artificial Intelligence, Biocomputation or Systems.
There's a noncomprehensive list of courses I've taken under the 'coursework' tab.

Over the past year I've been developing [Kanna](https://kanna.ai) - a patented, clinically validated system that can
detect eye diseases in children using just a mobilephone.
Outside my coursework, I'm currently working on scaling this healthcare solution for use in hospitals in India.

If you want to know more about other projects I've worked on, check out my
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/visweshk/),
and [Github](https://www.github.com/visweshk)!

I'm in the process of adding more stuff to this website. Stay tuned!
